TestFS tests a file system implementation. It walks the entire tree of files in fsys, opening and checking that each file behaves correctly. It also checks that the file system contains at least the expected files. As a special case, if no expected files are listed, fsys must be empty. Otherwise, fsys must contain at least the listed files; it can also contain others. The contents of fsys must not change concurrently with TestFS.
